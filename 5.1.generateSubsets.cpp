//     Example Walkthrough:
// Consider an array arr = {1, 2, 3}, and letâ€™s say we are iterating over the subsets (bitmasks) starting from mask = 0 to mask = 7 (for m = 3):

// For mask = 0 (binary 000), none of the bits are set, so no elements are included in the subset.
// For mask = 1 (binary 001), only the first bit is set, so arr[0] (which is 1) is included.
// For mask = 3 (binary 011), the first and second bits are set, so arr[0] (which is 1) and arr[1] (which is 2) are included.
// For mask = 7 (binary 111), all the bits are set, so all the elements arr[0], arr[1], and arr[2] are included.
